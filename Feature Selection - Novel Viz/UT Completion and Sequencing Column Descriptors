	Compl. Type (
		sleeve - used to shut off flow from one or more reservoir zones to regulatre pressure
		P & P - plug and perforation : putting a cement liner in place, clearing part of it out,
		and pumping a plug and perforating guns to a given depth. The plug is set and then the 
		cemented liner in that zone is perforated, creating a path for fracking fluid to be 
		forced into the shale formation. After perforation, the tools are removed from the well.
		Others - more specific completion types
		)

	12 month Cum Prod ([R] million barrels ?)
		Total ammount of oil produced in 12 months
